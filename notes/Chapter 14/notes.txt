Two Ways of Organizing, Importing and Exporting Code
    - Namespaces & File Bundling (The TS way)
        - Use "namespace" syntax to group related code
        - Per-file or bundled compilation is possible
    - ES Modules (The JS way - newer implementation)
        - use official ES Modules import / export syntax
        - Bundling via build tools (e.g., Webpack) is still possible

ES Modules are the recommended way
    - more maintainable and manageable
    - extra type safety
    - ensure every file has to clearly specify what it wants
    - ES Modules is not accessible in all browsers but bundling tools can make them accessible

Namespaces
    - better for smaller projects or where ES Modules are not available
    - doesn't contain pre-compilation error checking for imported modules
        - if a file is deleted then the file importing from it will also fail
