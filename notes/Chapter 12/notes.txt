Experimental Decorators
    - Uncomment experimentalDecorators in tsConfig.ts
    - Angular uses component decorators much the same way we make experimental decorators

Adding multiple decorators
    - more than one can be added anywhere that they are used
    - decorators execute bottom up
        - the one that is closest to the line of code its decorating runs first, then the next line above, etc.

Decorator locations
    - property decorators are executed when the class is recognized as a class
    - accessor
    - property
    - method
    - parameter

Decorators execute when the class is defined, before the class is initialized
    - decorators are capable of generating return values within their functions
    - great for utility functions like autobind
