Two Ways of Organizing, Importing and Exporting Code
    - Namespaces & File Bundling (The TS way)
        - Use "namespace" syntax to group related code
        - Per-file or bundled compilation is possible
    - ES Modules (The JS way - newer implementation)
        - use official ES Modules import / export syntax
        - Bundling via build tools (e.g., Webpack) is still possible
