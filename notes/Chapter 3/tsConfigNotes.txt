Projects that use most options will generally be set up beforehand

        - Disable TypeScript from Loading all subprojects into a single project into memory

Language & Environment Settings
    - Target: string => The version of JS code that TSC will produce
    - Lib   : []     => Allows the inclusion of special libraries

Modules Settings
    - Module : string => "NodeNext" or "Preserve" or etc - Controls imports and exports
    - rootDir: string => Controls which folder contains the source files

    - noEmitOnError : Boolean => Stop TSC from rendering JS files when an error would occur

Interop Constraints Settings

Type Checking Constraints
    - strict: boolean => enable all strict type-checking
        - With the strict set to true, no variable inferencing takes place
    - strictNullChecks : Dont accidentally work with null value

Node libraries are not included in TypeScript so it doesn't know their types
    - Requires the installation of extra type packages
