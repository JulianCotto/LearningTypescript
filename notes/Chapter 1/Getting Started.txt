TypeScript is a JS Superset
    - It is JS with extensions
    - Allows you to specify static variable types where JS is dynamically typed

Why use TypeScript?
    - Type coercion is a problem with JavaScript specifically with math
    - JS is always intakes strings that must be converted
        - if they aren't converted then type coercion or improper execution takes place
    - Data type errors are thrown which speeds up development flow
        - Troubleshooting type errors in JS can be obscure
        - Errors occur at compile time but also in editor so can be caught before compilation

Disadvantage of TypeScript
    - Does not run in the browser
    - Must be compiled into JS
    - npm install -g typescript
        - installs TypeScript globally and downloads TypeScript compiler
