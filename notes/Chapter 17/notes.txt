- Using Third Party Libraries
    - Example: LoDash library (JS written with no TS in mind)
        - _.chunk method import
        - npm install --save lodash
        - then install types (npm install --save-dev)
        - Added to package.json:
            "devDependencies": {
                "@types/lodash": "^4.17.20"
              }
        - To use external libraries it is essential to download the custom types that work with that library

- There are 3rd party libraries that are written with TS in mind and also those that are designed specifically for ts
    - libraries written in TS don't need to have corresponding ts types installed
        - prisma

- TypeScript first library like Zod
    - Zod - Allows you to define a schema
        - Define the shape of Data and do runtime validation where regular TS only allows compilation validation
