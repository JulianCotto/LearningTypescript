    - Code that interacts with other code. The other code makes up the application
    - @decoratorName()
        - Makes changes to what it applied to
    - A feature that allows us to write code that allows us to change the behavior of other code
    - Used in Angular Development to assign reusable HTML elements
    - Requires you to code in a certain way so that we can alter the behavior of other code
        - to which we attach decorators to

    - Typescript supports two different kinds of decorators
        - ECMAScript decorators
            - also a javascript feature

            - field
            - getter
            - setter

    - Decorator Code Execution
        - Decorator code is executed when it is attached to the class
        - Class code is executed when called
        - Methods are initialized before classes
            - Method decorators come first
        - Field code is executed after decorator code and so is undefined

    - Decorator factory
        - A function that produces a decorator
