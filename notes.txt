Typescript is a JS Superset
    - It is JS with extensions
    - Allows you to specify static variable types where JS are dynamically typed

Why use Typescript?
    - Type coercion is a problem with Javascript specifically with math
    - JS always intakes strings that must be converted
        - if they aren't converted then type coercion or improper execution takes place
    - Data type errors are thrown which speeds up development flow
        - Troubleshooting type errors in JS can be obscure

Disadvantage of Typescript
    - Does not run in the browser
    - Must be compiled into JS
    - npm install -g typescript
        - installs typescript globally and downloads typescript compiler
